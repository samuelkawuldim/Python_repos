# write a program in python that

# 2.use the += assignment operator to add 5 to the 'count'varable
# 3.print the value of count to the console.
# 4.use the -=assignment operator to subtract 3 from the 'count'varable.
# 5.print the value of count to the consloe.
# 6. use the *= assignment operator to multiply the 'count'variable by 2
# 7. print the value of 'count'to the console
